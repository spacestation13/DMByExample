# Installation

## ⚠⚠ WIP PAGE ⚠⚠

Downloading [BYOND] is easy to do!

When you get to the page it's recommended to download the BETA version of BYOND which includes everything you need to get started.

The reason for this being that the BETA version gets updated more often and usually includes more features and fixes than the stable version. It is also typically required if you are looking to contribute to an existing project in BYOND.

## Actually Installing BYOND

You can grab either the Windows or Linux version of BYOND; however, this guide assumes you are using a Windows OS.

For an easy installation simply click on the **Windows** button under **BETA**. This will download an executible file that you can run after the download is complete. The defaults are just fine unless you want to change the location that BYOND is installed to.

Once that's is all finished, you are ready to [get started with the DM language!](./hello_world.md)

## VSCode (Optional)
