# Language Server

## ⚠⚠ WIP PAGE ⚠⚠

A language server (protocol) is something that is used to help a tool/client and a server, that provides the actual "smartness", so that the client can use features like auto complete and the like. In even more layman terms, it's something that gives you the nice features that makes your coding life easier.

Unless you skipped the large recommendation on the second page, you should already have the language server for the DM language. This is what gave you, and VSCode, the ability to have searchable definitions and auto complete.
