## ⚠⚠ WIP PAGE ⚠⚠

A useful alternative to BYOND's built-in map editor, [StrongDMM] is a map editor to assist you with map creation. To get it simply go to the page and scroll down until you see **DOWNLOAD FOR WINDOWS**, the big blue button. Run it and point it to your project's .dme for the tool to understand your project's parameters. Then create/edit to your heart's content.
