# Procedures

Procedures, or procs, are declared using the `proc` keyword. These are also known by other names in other languages, such as functions or methods. Its arguments come after in parentheses. DM does not have a return type annotation like other languages.

If you are not declaring (therefore, you would be overriding) a new proc, you omit the `proc` keyword. See: `/mob/Login()` below.

The `return` statement can be used to return a value from within the proc, even from inside loops or if statements.

Let's rewrite FizzBuzz using a proc!

```dm
// Unlike C/C++, there's no restriction on the order of function definitions
/mob/Login()
	fizzbuzz_to(100)

// Returns a boolean value
/proc/is_divisible_by(lhs, rhs)
	// Edge case, early return
	if (rhs == 0)
		return FALSE

	return (lhs % rhs == 0)

/proc/fizzbuzz(n)
	if (is_divisible_by(n, 15))
		world << "fizzbuzz"
	else if (is_divisible_by(n, 3))
		world << "fizz"
	else if (is_divisible_by(n, 5))
		world << "buzz"
	else
		world << "[n]"

/proc/fizzbuzz_to(n)
	for (var/p in 1 to n+1)
		fizzbuzz(p)
```
